This is the second attempt to reimplement FreeBSD's pkg program in Ada.
The first one was a direct C-to-Ada conversion, which led to strange
coding that wouldn't normally be seen.  Moreover, the original pkg went
through organic changes which are still present.  This led to implementing
code that wasn't even used.  Moreover, pkg was designed as a library/client
instantiation but there is only one variant, leading to unnecesarily complex
and hard-to-follow coding.

After frustration, I'm starting over.  Ravensw2 is going to be a work-alike,
not a direct translation.  I'm not going to support a library model, nor use
the event manager heavily used in pkg.  For now the plan is to have an
identical database schema as pkg (and maintaining functional compatibily in
the future) but lets see how that plays out.

I'll try to salvage as much code from the first attempt as I can.  There's a
lot that can be reused.
