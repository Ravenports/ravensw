.El
.Sh REPOSITORY CONFIGURATION
To use a repository you will need at least one repository
configuration file.
.Pp
Repository configuration files are searched for in directories listed in the
.Cm REPOS_DIR
array,
which defaults to
.Pa /raven/etc/ravensw/repos/ .
.Pp
Filenames are not arbitrary; they must end in
.Sq .conf
For example
.Pa /raven/etc/ravensw/repos/myrepo.conf .
.Pp
A repository file is in UCL format and has the following form:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm myrepo:"
.It Cm myrepo :
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm MIRROR_TYPE: string"
.It Cm ENV: object
A list of key value entries that will be passed as environement variable
for the bundled
.Xr fetch 3 ,
per repository.
.It Cm URL: string
URL for this repository only.
.It Cm ENABLED: boolean
The repository will be used only if this option is enabled.
Default: YES.
.It Cm MIRROR_TYPE: string
MIRROR_TYPE for this repository only.
Default: NONE.
Any of
.Dv HTTP
or
.Dv SRV
or
.Dv NONE .
.It Cm SIGNATURE_TYPE: string
Specifies what type of signature this repository uses.
Can be one of
.Dv NONE ,
.Dv PUBKEY or
.Dv FINGERPRINTS .
(default: NONE)
.It Cm PUBKEY: string
This should be set to a path containing public key for this repository
only. (default: NONE)
.It Cm FINGERPRINTS: string
This should be set to a path containing known signatures for the repository.
.It Cm IP_VERSION: integer
Restrict network access to specified IP version.
4 will only allow IPv4 and 6 will only allow IPv6.
Any other value will use the system default.
This option overrides the global setting with the same name and can be
overwritten by a command line option.
Default: 0.
.It Cm PRIORITY: integer
Set the priority of the repository.
Higher values are used preferentially over lower ones.
Default: 0
.El
.El
.Pp
For a
.Cm MIRROR_TYPE
of
.Dv NONE ,
any of the URL schemes supported by
.Xr libfetch 3
can be used, including:
.Dv http:// ,
.Dv https:// ,
.Dv ftp:// ,
or
.Dv file:// .
In addition a
.Dv ssh://
URL scheme is also supported.
Where
.Sy MIRROR_TYPE
is
.Dv SRV ,
you should use a
.Dv rsw+http://
or
.Dv rsw+https://
(etc.) URL scheme.
Using an
.Dv http://
URL implies that the hostname part is a simple hostname according to
RFC 2616, and is no longer accepted.
.Pp
When
.Sy SIGNATURE_TYPE
is
.Dv NONE ,
then no signature checking will be done on the repository.
When
.Sy SIGNATURE_TYPE
is
.Dv PUBKEY ,
then the
.Sy PUBKEY
option will be used for signature verification.
This option is for use with the built-in signing support.
When
.Sy SIGNATURE_TYPE
is
.Dv FINGERPRINTS ,
then the
.Sy FINGERPRINTS
option will be used for signature verification.
This option is for use with an external signing command.
See
.Xr ravensw-repo 8
for more discussion on signature types.
.Pp
If
.Sy FINGERPRINTS
is set to
.Pa /raven/etc/ravensw/fingerprints/myrepo ,
then the directories
.Pa /raven/etc/ravensw/fingerprints/myrepo/trusted
and
.Pa /raven/etc/ravensw/fingerprints/myrepo/revoked
should exist with known good and bad fingerprints, respectively.
Files in those directories should be in the format:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
function: sha256
fingerprint: sha256_representation_of_the_public_key
.Ed
.Pp
The repository tag
.Fa myrepo
is an arbitrary string.
Reusing the repository tag will cause those items defined in
configuration files later on the
.Sy REPOS_DIR
search path to overwrite the equivalent settings for the same tag
earlier on the search path.
.Pp
Repositories are sorted in order of priority (descending), and then
alphabetically by repository key.
Packages are selected preferentially out of all the repositories that contain
them from the repository with the highest priority, so long as they are
suitable to solve the necessary dependency requirements.
However, this preference may be overruled when
.Sy CONSERVATIVE_UPGRADE
is set to
.Dv true ,
in which case a package will as far as possible always be upgraded from the
same repository the older installed version came from, as given in the
.Sy repository
annotation of the installed package.
See
.Xr ravensw-repository 8
for details.
.Pp
It is possible to specify more than one repository per file.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
An environment variable with the same name as the option in the
configuration file always overrides the value of an option set in the
file.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Repository configuration file:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
FreeBSD: {
    url: "rsw+http://pkg.freebsd.org/${ABI}/latest",
    enabled: true,
    signature_type: "fingerprints",
    fingerprints: "/usr/share/keys/pkg",
    mirror_type: "srv"
}
